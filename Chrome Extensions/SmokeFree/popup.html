    <button id="infoButton" title="When you're on the journey to quit smoking, cravings can often feel overwhelming. However, there are various tools and strategies you can use to help manage these urges. Exercise, for instance, not only distracts you but also releases endorphins, helping to reduce stress and improve mood. Fidget toys can keep your hands busy when cravings strike, providing a physical distraction from the urge to smoke. Chewing gum can help curb the oral fixation often associated with smoking. Deep breathing exercises can also be a powerful tool, helping to calm your mind and body. Remember, each craving will pass, and using these strategies can help you navigate through them. Quitting smoking brings numerous health benefits. It reduces your risk of various diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. Your lung function begins to improve, you'll have more energy, and even your sense of taste and smell can return to normal.">Motivation</button>
